# clinical-trial-finder-UI
UI repo for Clinical Trial Finder
## MVP
    - My project is deployed here: (https://clinical-trial-finder.netlify.com/)
    - Product Canvas (https://trello.com/b/ANZp9XbL/clinical-trial)

    The drug development process is in crisis. Returns on R&D have been decreasing for decades and fewer drugs are reaching the market. One contributing factor to this crisis is the lack of information transparency in the clinical trial market (a key part of the drug development process).
    An astounding 80% of clinical trials fail to meet recruitment timelines and 1 in 4 cancer research trials falter due to low patient recruitment. Many patients do not even know these trials exist.
    As Lambda students we have developed a solution that increases information transparency and helps patients (and family members) evaluate potentially life-saving clinical trials. In the process, recruiting enough participants for the study to make.


## Team Contributions
    - I participated in the morning and afternoon standup meeting, being vocal about needs.
    - I co-designed the layout, color palette, and theme for our project.
    - I completed a portion of the product canvas.

## HTML/CSS
    - I co-designed the layout/theme. I used flex box to create majority of my layout.
    - Used symantic HTML.
    - Researched how to make my 'find your trial' button clickable, and hover effects, and color gradients.
    - I added social media icons and a subcribe to newsletter input box.
    - I used LESS for my styles.
    - I created a hover effect over the introduction with box-shadowing.
    - hover effects on buttons and links.
    - Links at top of page take you to that section of the site.

## Responsiveness
    - I used mobile first (500px or less) in the design and site is fully responsive to tablet @ 800px and desktop @ 1000px. 
    - I made my text responsive using rems.
    - I also used max-width to keep things from stretching too much with larger screen sizes.

## Accessibility
    - Symantic HTML was used
    - Responsive design in text
    - img alt tags used
